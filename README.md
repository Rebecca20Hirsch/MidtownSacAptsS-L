This is an analysis of a sample of about 45 apartments in Midtown Sacramento, CA that were listed between March and April 2020.
The data was collected from websites such as apartments.com, and other listing services.

Data on parking, year built, square footage, monthly rent, amenities, latitude & longitude, and complex size were collected for each unit

Several tools were used to analyze the data, including R/RStudio, and the built-in graphing on Google Sheets.
GeoDa or another GIS program might also come in handy for analysing this data for patterns.

The goal is to have a collection of graphs, maps, and charts, that will illuminate trends, patterns, and variables in apartment rentals in Midtown Sacramento
